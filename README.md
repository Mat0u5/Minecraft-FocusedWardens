**Usage**:

```/focusedwardens enable/disable``` - Enables/Disables the functionality of this mod.

```/focusedwardens settings``` - Modifies the config of the mod (can also be done manually by changing the config file).


**Subcommands**:

```/focusedwardens settings ignoreNonEntitySounds enable/disable``` - Makes the wardens ignore all sounds not caused by an entity (for example: redstone components).

```/focusedwardens settings ignoreNonPlayerSounds enable/disable``` - Makes the wardens ignore all sounds that did not come from players. (So this makes wardens ignore other mobs, and also non-entity sounds).
